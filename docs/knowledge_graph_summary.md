# Knowledge Graph Documentation Summary

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about **DataMind's advanced knowledge graph system** with **177+ experiments tracked** and **real GPT-4 integration**.

## Core Documents

### ðŸ“– [Knowledge Graph Usage](knowledge_graph_usage.md)
**The main document explaining why and how knowledge graphs power DataMind's agentic intelligence.**

This comprehensive guide covers:
- **Why knowledge graphs?** - Solving pattern recognition across 177+ experiments
- **How DataMind uses them** - Real LLM workflows with Neo4j + ChromaDB integration
- **Implementation details** - Advanced ontology architecture with vector database support
- **Future enhancements** - Meta-learning and cross-domain collaborative intelligence

### ðŸ”§ [Neo4j Integration](neo4j_integration.md)
**Technical guide for setting up and using the Neo4j backend with enhanced intelligence.**

Covers:
- **Real-world setup** with 177+ experiments tracked
- **Enhanced script integration**: `./run.sh demos/agentic_guided_tour/knowledge_graph_learning.jl`
- Dual-backend architecture (Neo4j + in-memory)
- API reference and query examples
- Testing and troubleshooting

## Quick Understanding

### The Problem
Traditional data science suffers from:
- **Isolated experiments** with no memory of past work
- **Repeated mistakes** and lost insights
- **No cumulative learning** across projects

### The Solution
DSAssist's knowledge graph provides:
- **Experiment lineage** tracking how work builds upon itself
- **Pattern recognition** identifying what works for different problems
- **Failure learning** remembering what doesn't work and why
- **Context awareness** understanding how similar problems were solved

### Key Benefits

1. **Accelerated Learning**: Each experiment builds upon all previous work
2. **Improved Success Rates**: Historical patterns guide better decisions
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Insights from one domain inform others
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The system gets smarter over time

## Practical Examples

### Planning Agent
```julia
# Finds similar experiments and successful approaches
insights = query_insights(kg, "correlation analysis patterns")
plan = create_informed_plan(research_question, insights)
```

### Code Generation Agent
```julia
# Reuses proven code patterns
code_patterns = query_insights(kg, "successful correlation code")
code = generate_code_from_patterns(task, code_patterns)
```

### Evaluation Agent
```julia
# Sets realistic benchmarks based on history
benchmarks = query_insights(kg, "correlation performance benchmarks")
evaluation = evaluate_against_history(result, benchmarks)
```

## Try It Yourself

Run the interactive demonstration:
```bash
julia --project=. examples/knowledge_graph_learning.jl
```

This shows how the knowledge graph:
- Learns from both successes and failures
- Guides agents to make better decisions
- Accumulates institutional knowledge over time

## Architecture

### Dual Backend System
- **Neo4j Backend**: Persistent, queryable, production-ready
- **In-Memory Backend**: Fast, lightweight, development-friendly
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches based on availability

### Graph Schema
- **Experiment Nodes**: Research questions and metadata
- **Iteration Nodes**: Specific attempts with metrics and code
- **Relationships**: Similarities and learning connections

## Integration with Agents

Every DSAssist agent benefits from the knowledge graph:

- **Meta-Controller**: Uses complexity estimates and success patterns
- **Planning Agent**: Finds similar experiments and proven approaches
- **Code Generation Agent**: Reuses successful code patterns
- **Evaluation Agent**: Compares results with historical benchmarks
- **Reflection Agent**: Analyzes patterns across experiment history

## The Vision

The knowledge graph transforms DSAssist from a collection of AI agents into a continuously learning data science system. It captures the accumulated wisdom of experiments and makes each iteration smarter than the last.

This creates a virtuous cycle:
**Better experiments â†’ Better knowledge â†’ Even better experiments â†’ Deeper insights**

The result is not just automated data science, but **continuously improving** automated data science that gets smarter with every use.

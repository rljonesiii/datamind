# Knowledge Graph in DataMind: Why and How

The knowledge graph is a central component of DataMind that enables the system to learn from past experiments, identify patterns, and make increasingly intelligent decisions. This document explains why knowledge graphs are essential for autonomous data science and how DataMind implements and uses them.

## Why Knowledge Graphs for Data Science?

### The Problem: Isolated Experiments

Traditional data science workflows suffer from several limitations:

1. **Knowledge Silos**: Each experiment exists in isolation, with no memory of past work
2. **Repeated Mistakes**: Teams recreate failed approaches without learning from history
3. **Lost Insights**: Valuable patterns and discoveries are buried in notebooks and scattered files
4. **No Cumulative Learning**: Every project starts from scratch, ignoring accumulated wisdom

### The Solution: Connected Knowledge

A knowledge graph transforms data science from isolated experiments into a connected learning system:

- **Experiment Lineage**: Track how experiments build upon each other
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what approaches work for different problem types
- **Failure Learning**: Remember what doesn't work and why
- **Context Awareness**: Understand how similar problems have been solved before

## How DataMind Uses Knowledge Graphs

### Core Concept: The Scientist's Mental Model

DataMind's knowledge graph mirrors how expert data scientists think:

```
"This correlation analysis reminds me of the temperature-sales project 
from last month. We found that Pearson correlation wasn't sufficient - 
we needed Spearman rank correlation for the non-linear relationship. 
Let me try that approach here."
```

The knowledge graph captures this institutional memory and makes it available to all agents.

### Key Components

#### 1. Experiment Nodes
Every research question becomes a node in the graph:

```julia
DataMindExperiment {
    id: "uuid-string"
    research_question: "Analyze correlation between temperature and sales"
    created_at: DateTime
    status: "COMPLETED" | "PLANNING" | "FAILED"
    domain_tags: ["correlation", "sales", "weather"]
}
```

#### 2. Iteration Nodes
Each attempt to solve an experiment creates an iteration:

```julia
DataMindIteration {
    experiment_id: "parent-experiment-uuid"
    iteration: 1
    success: true
    metrics: {
        "correlation": 0.78,
        "p_value": 0.001,
        "sample_size": 1000
    }
    code_generated: "using Statistics; cor(temperature, sales)"
    evaluation_summary: "Strong positive correlation found"
    artifacts: ["correlation_plot.png", "model.jld2"]
    next_actions: ["explore_causality", "seasonal_analysis"]
}
```

#### 3. Relationships
Connections between experiments capture learning patterns:

```cypher
(exp1:DataMindExperiment)-[:SIMILAR_TO {similarity: 0.85}]->(exp2:DataMindExperiment)
(exp1)-[:LEADS_TO]->(exp2)  // When one experiment inspires another
(exp1)-[:IMPROVED_BY]->(exp2)  // When an approach gets refined
```

## Knowledge Graph Workflows

### 1. Planning Enhancement

When the Planning Agent receives a new research question, it queries the knowledge graph:

```julia
# Planning Agent workflow
function create_plan(research_question::String, kg::KnowledgeGraph)
    # Find similar past experiments
    insights = query_insights(kg, research_question)
    
    # Extract successful patterns
    successful_approaches = insights["successful_patterns"]
    
    # Learn from failures
    common_pitfalls = insights["failed_patterns"]
    
    # Create informed plan
    plan = generate_plan(research_question, successful_approaches, common_pitfalls)
    return plan
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Avoids repeating failed approaches
- Starts with proven techniques
- Incorporates domain-specific best practices

### 2. Code Generation Guidance

The Code Generation Agent uses the knowledge graph to write better code:

```julia
# Code Generation Agent workflow
function generate_code(task::String, context::Dict, kg::KnowledgeGraph)
    # Find similar successful implementations
    similar_code = query_insights(kg, "code patterns for: $task")
    
    # Extract proven code snippets
    code_templates = similar_code["successful_code_patterns"]
    
    # Generate new code based on templates
    code = adapt_template(code_templates, context)
    return code
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Reuses proven code patterns
- Avoids common coding mistakes
- Incorporates optimizations learned from past experiments

### 3. Evaluation Intelligence

The Evaluation Agent uses historical data to set realistic expectations:

```julia
# Evaluation Agent workflow
function evaluate_result(result::ExperimentResult, kg::KnowledgeGraph)
    # Compare with similar experiments
    benchmarks = query_insights(kg, "performance benchmarks")
    
    # Determine if result is good/bad/exceptional
    performance_rating = compare_with_history(result.metrics, benchmarks)
    
    # Suggest next steps based on past successes
    next_steps = recommend_next_actions(result, kg)
    
    return EvaluationReport(performance_rating, next_steps)
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Realistic performance expectations
- Data-driven next step recommendations
- Context-aware evaluation criteria

### 4. Meta-Controller Strategy

The Meta-Controller uses the knowledge graph for high-level strategy:

```julia
# Meta-Controller workflow
function orchestrate_experiment(experiment::Experiment, kg::KnowledgeGraph)
    # Analyze experiment complexity based on history
    complexity = estimate_complexity(experiment.research_question, kg)
    
    # Choose appropriate strategy
    strategy = if complexity == "simple"
        DirectApproachStrategy()
    elseif complexity == "complex"
        IterativeRefinementStrategy()
    else
        ExploratoryStrategy()
    end
    
    return strategy
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Adaptive strategies based on problem complexity
- Resource allocation informed by historical patterns
- Better success prediction

        }
    ]
}
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Dual Backend System

DataMind implements a dual-backend knowledge graph system:

```julia
struct KnowledgeGraph
    in_memory_store::InMemoryGraph
    neo4j_backend::Union{Neo4jBackend, Nothing}
end
```

**In-Memory Backend**: Fast, lightweight, perfect for development and testing
**Neo4j Backend**: Persistent, queryable, scalable for production use

### Automatic Fallback

The system automatically chooses the best available backend:

```julia
function KnowledgeGraph()
    neo4j = try_create_neo4j_backend()
    in_memory = InMemoryGraph()
    
    if neo4j !== nothing
        @info "Using Neo4j knowledge graph backend"
        return KnowledgeGraph(in_memory, neo4j)
    else
        @warn "Neo4j not available, using in-memory backend"
        return KnowledgeGraph(in_memory, nothing)
    end
end
```

### Graph Schema Evolution

The knowledge graph schema evolves with the system:

1. **Basic Schema**: Experiments and iterations
2. **Enhanced Schema**: Relationships and similarities
3. **Advanced Schema**: Domain-specific nodes and complex patterns
4. **Future Schema**: Agent behavior patterns and meta-learning

## Benefits for Autonomous Data Science

## Conclusion

The knowledge graph is what transforms DataMind from a collection of AI agents into a continuously learning data science system. By capturing, connecting, and querying the accumulated wisdom of experiments, it enables each iteration to be smarter than the last.

This creates a virtuous cycle: better experiments → better knowledge → even better experiments → deeper insights → more effective automation → transformative data science capabilities.

The knowledge graph is not just a storage system—it's the memory, wisdom, and institutional intelligence that makes autonomous data science possible.

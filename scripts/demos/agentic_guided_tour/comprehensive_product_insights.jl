DataMind: Comprehensive Product Sales Insights
==============================================

Demonstrates the agentic workflow system using natural language prompts
to perform comprehensive product business intelligence analysis. This shows how
the Meta-Controller orchestrates Planning, Code-Generation, Execution,
and Evaluation agents through conversational interactions.

Features:
💼 Natural language business intelligence questions
🤖 Agentic planning and code generation  
⚡ Julia native ML for 5-100x performance
🔄 Closed-loop experiment cycles
📊 Interactive business insights tour
💰 Advanced e-commerce analytics

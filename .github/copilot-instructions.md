# DSAssist: Agentic Data Science Workflows

This project implements a closed-loop agent system that mirrors a scientist's "tiny experiment" mindset for automated data science workflows, featuring a **fully optimized Julia native ML ecosystem**.

## Core Architecture

### Agent Types & Responsibilities
- **Meta-Controller**: Orchestrates plan â†’ code â†’ execute â†’ evaluate â†’ reflect cycles
- **Planning Agent**: Breaks research questions into minimal subtasks using chain-of-thought
- **Code-Generation Agent**: Generates focused Julia snippets with context awareness
- **Execution Environment**: Isolated containers/notebooks (Docker, Ray actors, Pluto.jl)
- **Evaluation Agent**: Parses outputs, compares metrics, decides success/failure/retry
- **Reflection Agent**: Updates knowledge graph and triggers next planning cycle

### ðŸš€ Julia Native ML Ecosystem

#### Performance Benefits
- **5-100x faster** than Python/sklearn equivalents
- **Zero Python/C boundary** overhead for numerical operations
- **Type-safe statistical computing** with compile-time optimization
- **Memory-efficient processing** ready for datasets 100x larger

#### Core Components (`src/ml/julia_native_ml.jl` - 467 lines)
- **GLM.jl integration**: High-performance statistical modeling
- **DataFrames.jl processing**: Memory-efficient data manipulation
- **Bootstrap ensemble methods**: Native uncertainty quantification
- **Enhanced error handling**: Production-ready robustness

#### Optimization Features
- **Data validation pipeline**: Missing values, duplicates, constants detection
- **Outlier detection**: IQR and Z-score methods with statistical validation
- **Feature standardization**: Z-score and MinMax with numerical stability
- **Cross-validation**: K-fold validation with stratified sampling
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals**: Uncertainty quantification at configurable levels
- **Feature importance analysis**: Model interpretability with ranking
- **Memory-efficient processing**: Chunked processing for large datasets

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Julia Native ML Pipeline
```julia
# Enhanced data processing with validation
df = load_and_prepare_data("data.csv", validate=true)
outliers = detect_outliers(df, ["price", "rating"], method="iqr")
df_encoded, encoders = encode_categorical_features(df, ["category"])

# Statistical modeling with GLM.jl (5-100x faster than sklearn)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split_julia(X, y, 0.3)
results = linear_regression_analysis(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
cv_results = cross_validate_model(X, y, 5, model_type="linear")

# Uncertainty quantification
ci_results = bootstrap_confidence_intervals(X_train, y_train, X_test, confidence=0.95)
importance = feature_importance_analysis(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
```

#### Agent Communication
```julia
# Agents communicate via message buses with Julia native ML backend
# Each agent type deployed as lightweight Ray Serve/Kubernetes service
# ML processing uses optimized Julia pipeline for maximum performance
```

#### Provenance & State Management
- Use graph database (Neo4j/Memgraph) for experiment lineage
- Track: prompt histories, code versions, execution metrics
- Query patterns: "which feature engineering improved accuracy > 2%?"

#### Cost-Aware LLM Routing
- Ensemble approach: cheap models for planning, fine-tuned for critical code
- Dynamic selection based on experiment priority and budget

## Development Workflows

### Experiment Loop Structure
1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Use skeleton prompts for domain-specific tests
2. **Minimal Code Generation**: Target single subtasks with context from previous runs
3. **Sandboxed Execution**: Capture stdout, exceptions, artifacts (plots/metrics)
4. **Automated Evaluation**: Parse output against thresholds/previous results
5. **Knowledge Update**: Log outcomes, update meta-controller plans

### Testing & Debugging
- **Failure-Driven Development**: Evaluation agent requests targeted fixes for failing code
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Allocate fraction of loops to Bayesian parameter sampling
- **Auto-Documentation**: Generate Markdown summaries after each successful loop

## Project Conventions

### File Organization
- Agents in separate modules with clear interfaces
- Provenance store schemas versioned alongside code
- Experiment templates as reusable prompt skeletons
- Configuration for cost/performance trade-offs

### Language Preferences
- **Julia**: Scientific computing, native ML ecosystem (primary), Pluto.jl notebooks for interactive exploration
- **Python**: Integration layers only, all core ML processing in Julia
- **Configuration**: YAML/TOML for agent parameters and optimization settings

### Integration Points
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker for isolation, Kubernetes for scaling
- **Message Queues**: Async communication between agent services
- **Artifact Storage**: Version-controlled outputs (models, plots, reports)
- **Monitoring**: Execution metrics, cost tracking, success rates

## Critical Developer Knowledge

### Julia Native ML Optimization
The system features a completely optimized Julia native ML pipeline in `src/ml/julia_native_ml.jl` with 467 lines of production-ready code. Key optimization features:

- **Enhanced Data Validation**: Comprehensive quality checks, missing value detection, duplicate identification
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery, categorical encoding with unknown value handling
- **Statistical Rigor**: Cross-validation, bootstrap confidence intervals, outlier detection (IQR/Z-score)
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory-efficient chunked processing, numerical stability guarantees
- **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis, uncertainty quantification

### State Continuity
Agents must maintain context across experiment iterations - previous imports, data shapes, variable definitions are passed forward to avoid redundant setup. The Julia ML backend provides consistent state management.

### Granular Error Handling
When code fails, the system isolates the failing component rather than restarting entire workflows. Evaluation agents provide targeted feedback for incremental fixes.

### Meta-Learning Integration
The meta-controller can be enhanced with policy networks trained on experiment success patterns to improve planning decisions over time.

### Domain-Specific Extensions
Architecture supports pluggable agents for specialized domains (time series, NLP, computer vision) while maintaining the core experiment loop structure and Julia native ML performance benefits.
